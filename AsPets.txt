Domesticated rats, selectively bred for specific traits, have been kept as pets since at least the late 19th century. Pet rats are most commonly domesticated variants of the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), though other species, such as the black rat (Rattus rattus) and the giant pouched rat (Cricetomys spp.), are also occasionally kept. Pet rats behave differently from their wild counterparts depending on how many generations they have been kept as pets.[20] Pet rats do not pose any more of a risk of zoonotic diseases than pets such as cats or dogs.[21] Tamed rats are generally friendly and can be taught to perform selected behaviors.

Selective breeding has brought about different color and marking varieties in rats. Genetic mutations have also created different fur types, such as rex and hairless. Congenital malformation in selective breeding have created the dumbo rat, a popular pet choice due to their low, saucer-shaped ears.[22] A breeding standard exists for rat fanciers wishing to breed and show their rat at a rat show.
